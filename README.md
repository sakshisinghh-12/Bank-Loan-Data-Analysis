# Bank-Loan-Data-Analysis

# Project Overview
This project analyzes bank loan data to create a comprehensive Bank Loan Report that provides insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time. The dashboard helps in making data-driven decisions, tracking loan portfolio health, and identifying trends to inform lending strategies.

# Objective
The primary objective is to build an interactive Excel dashboard that:

Monitors and assesses bank lending activities and performance

Provides insights into key loan-related metrics

Distinguishes between "Good Loans" and "Bad Loans"

Visualizes loan trends and statistics across different dimensions

Enables data-driven decision making for lending strategies


1. Summary Dashboard

The Summary Dashboard presents key performance indicators for the bank's loan portfolio:

-Total loan applications (38.6K) with MTD and MoM tracking

-Total funded amount ($435.8M) with MTD and MoM analysis

-Total amount received ($473.1M) with MTD and MoM trends

-Average interest rate (12.05%) with MTD variations

-Average DTI (13.33%) with MTD fluctuations

The dashboard also distinguishes between:

-Good Loans: 86.18% of applications (33.2K) with $370.2M funded and $435.8M received

-Bad Loans: 13.82% of applications (5.3K) with $65.5M funded and $37.3M received

A loan status grid view provides detailed metrics for each loan status category (Fully Paid, Charged Off, Current).


2. Overview Dashboard

The Overview Dashboard visualizes critical loan metrics through various chart types:

-Monthly trends by issue date (line chart)

-Regional analysis by state (treemap)

-Loan term analysis (donut chart - 36 months vs. 60 months)

-Employee length analysis (bar chart)

-Loan purpose breakdown (bar chart - credit card, home improvement, etc.)

-Home ownership analysis (treemap - mortgage, rent, own)

3. Details Dashboard

The Details Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of all essential information within the loan data, serving as a one-stop solution for users seeking detailed insights into the loan portfolio, borrower profiles, and loan performance.
